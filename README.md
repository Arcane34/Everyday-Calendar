# Everyday-Calendar
A visual representation of the Everyday calendar made by Simone Giertz to track the progress of new year's resolutions throughout the year.

It follows the same principle as the original idea where you essentially press a button to activate the light of a specific day in the year to show you have followed the resolutions for that particular day.

However, as it is made via code, instead of implementing every button as a basic light system, I wanted the button to cycle through an array of colors seamlessly creating an aesthetically pleasing pattern across
the board if the user has ensured they follow their resolutions on multiple days consecutively. This is done to ensure the action of pressing the button is fun, pleasing and satisfying to the user, giving them a 
reward for their effort.
